# Ludum Dare Collection

## About

This repository gathers the source code for all my personal entries for the [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) 48h game jam competition. 

Over the past few years, I made a total of **7 games** of all sort: platformers, puzzle-games, side-shooter and survival.

All these games are written in Javascript using HTML5's Canvas and/or WebGL.
