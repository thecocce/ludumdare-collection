About
-----

**Flyght** is a little arcade shooter game, made during the 48h compo using HTML5 and Javascript.
I wrote everything from scratch and only use one external library for the sounds/musics (https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-audio-fx).

Instructions
------------

MOVE: Array keys. 
SHOOT: Spacebar, or V key. 

Bonuses will increase your character abilities (speed, shooting rate, bullet numbers and speed). 
You can't die, but your score will drop if you get hit.
